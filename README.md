# React Tic Tac Toe+

This is simply a completion of the tic tac toe tutorial on react.dev. However, I took some liberties in my solution, so this looks a bit different from the final solution in the tutorial. Since I was doing this locally rather than in a Codepen, I also added some tooling for development including Typescript, pnpm, ESLint and Prettier.

#### Log

I took some notes along the way, including impressions about React and the tutorial. It's mostly ramblings, but it's there in LOG.md if anyone cares.

#### Ideas for ++

- Use Redux to handle game state. It's probably not enough state to be necessary, but would be a simple showcase
- It would be fun to use WebSocket to turn this into a p2p multiplayer game
- Try to build other abstract strategy games
  - Gomoku
  - Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
  - Lines of Action
